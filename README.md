A side project to explore the use of computer vision in detecting and analyzing athletic motions


This project is a computer vision-based tool designed to analyze and visualize body motion angles for athletes. It leverages MediaPipe Pose and OpenCV to detect key body landmarks in video frames and calculate joint angles (e.g., knees and elbows) in real-time. The tool outputs the detected angles to the screen and saves them to a CSV file for further analysis.

The goal was to understand how technology can assist in evaluating and improving sports techniques through real-time data.
